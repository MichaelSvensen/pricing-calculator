# pricing-calculator

[Edit in StackBlitz next generation editor ⚡️](https://stackblitz.com/~/github.com/MichaelSvensen/pricing-calculator)

Pricing calculator for accounting firms offering fixed price agreements.

Intended functionality and its completeness
- Should be able to price each element of the accounting delivery and it should be dynamic: Status - 80% there. All prices aren't immmediately updated based on selections in the calculator.
- All inputs needs to be configurable: status - we have settings view which can configure everything, but it's not necessarily connected correctly.
- Industry variables need to be reflected in the pricing and the configuration/Settings view should have multiple ways of calculating the price

This should be part of the lead/deal flow in the main app (CRM). Ideally, we should be able to price the assignment on the fly using this calculator.
